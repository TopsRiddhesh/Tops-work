// What is DNS?

/*Ans:
DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a hierarchical and distributed naming system used to translate human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) and vice versa.

DNS plays a critical role in internet communication, enabling seamless navigation and connectivity by translating human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses. It is essential for accessing websites, sending emails, and connecting to various online services across the internet.
