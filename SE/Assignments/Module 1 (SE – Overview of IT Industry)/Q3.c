// What are the types of Languages?

/* Ans:
There are three types of Languages

1. High-Level Programming Language:

Definition: A high-level programming language is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. It is abstracted from the low-level details of the computer's architecture, focusing more on expressing algorithms and logic in a way that is closer to human language.

2. Middle-Level (Intermediate-Level) Programming Language:

Definition: Middle-level programming languages provide a balance between high-level and low-level languages. They offer some level of abstraction from the computer's hardware but also allow more direct control over system resources compared to high-level languages.

3. Low-Level Programming Language:

Definition: Low-level programming languages are close to the hardware and provide little to no abstraction from the computer's architecture. They directly represent machine instructions and hardware operations, offering precise control over system resources.*/
