// What is SDLC & types of SDLC?

/*Ans: SLDC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It refers to the process used by software development teams to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications. The SLDC encompasses all the steps and activities involved in software development from initial planning through maintenance and updates.

Types of SDLC

There are several types of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) methodologies, each with its own approach to managing the software development process. The choice of SDLC methodology depends on factors such as project requirements, team size, timeline, and organizational preferences. Here are some common types of SDLC methodologies:

1. Waterfall Model:

The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach to software development. It progresses through defined phases in a strict order: Requirements gathering, System design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Each phase must be completed before the next phase begins, making it easy to understand and manage, but less flexible to changes late in the process.

2. Agile Model:

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between cross-functional teams. It emphasizes flexibility and customer feedback, with shorter development cycles known as sprints. Agile methodologies include Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP), and others, focusing on delivering working software quickly and continuously improving it based on feedback.

3. Iterative Model:

The Iterative model breaks down the software development process into smaller, repeated cycles (iterations). Each iteration includes phases like requirements, design, implementation, and testing. It allows for feedback and adjustments between iterations, promoting incremental development and improvements over time.

4. Spiral Model:

The Spiral model combines elements of both Waterfall and Iterative models with a focus on risk assessment and management. It consists of multiple cycles or spirals, each involving planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation. It is suitable for projects where risk management and frequent evaluation are critical.

5. V-Model (Verification and Validation Model):

The V-Model is an extension of the Waterfall model where each development phase has a corresponding testing phase. It emphasizes verification and validation at each stage, ensuring that requirements are thoroughly tested before moving to the next phase. It provides a structured approach to testing and validation but can be rigid and less adaptable to changes.

6. Incremental Model:

The Incremental model divides the software development process into smaller, manageable parts (increments). Each increment passes through the phases of the Waterfall model, from requirements to maintenance. It allows for partial deployment and delivery of the software, making it suitable for large-scale projects with long development cycles.

7. RAD Model (Rapid Application Development):

The RAD model emphasizes rapid prototyping and iterative development with minimal planning. It focuses on quick development and feedback, using tools and techniques like prototyping, reusable components, and iterative development cycles. RAD is suitable for projects where speed and user feedback are crucial.

8. DevOps Model:

DevOps (Development and Operations) is not a traditional SDLC model but rather an approach that integrates development and IT operations teams. It emphasizes automation, continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and collaboration between teams to accelerate software development, deployment, and maintenance.*/
