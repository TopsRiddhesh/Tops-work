// How to clone repository in a local system

/*Ans:
To clone a repository from a remote location (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) to your local system, follow these general steps:

Get the Repository URL: First, you need the URL of the repository you want to clone. You can usually find this on the repository's page on the hosting service (e.g., GitHub).

Open Terminal or Command Prompt: Depending on your operating system, open a terminal (Linux, macOS) or command prompt (Windows).

Navigate to the Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

Replace https://github.com/username/repository.git with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone.

Authenticate (if needed): If the repository is private and requires authentication, you might be prompted to enter your credentials (username and password or a personal access token).

Wait for the Clone to Complete: Git will clone the repository from the remote location to your local system. Once it's done, you'll see a message indicating the cloning was successful.

Navigate into the Cloned Repository: After cloning, you can use cd to enter the newly cloned repository:

Replace repository-name with the actual name of the repository you cloned.
