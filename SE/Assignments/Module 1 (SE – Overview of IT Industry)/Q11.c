// What is IP & define IPv4 & IPv6?

/*Ans:
IP (Internet Protocol):

IP (Internet Protocol) is a fundamental protocol used in the Internet Protocol suite (TCP/IP) to facilitate communication and data transfer between devices connected to a network. It provides an addressing system that uniquely identifies each device on a network and enables packets of data to be routed across the internet.

IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):

IPv4 is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol and the most widely used version on the internet today. Here are its key characteristics:

Address Format: IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numerical addresses written in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
Address Space: IPv4 provides approximately 4.3 billion unique IP addresses.
Format: Divided into four octets (8 bits each), separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
Limitations: IPv4's 32-bit address space has led to exhaustion of available addresses due to the growth of the internet and proliferation of connected devices.
IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):

IPv6 is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol designed to replace IPv4. Here are its key characteristics:

Address Format: IPv6 addresses are 128-bit numerical addresses written in hexadecimal notation (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
Address Space: IPv6 provides approximately 340 undecillion (3.4 Ã— 10^38) unique IP addresses.
Format: Divided into eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
Advantages: IPv6 offers a larger address space, improved security features, and better support for mobile devices and IoT (Internet of Things) devices.
Transition: Although IPv6 adoption is increasing, IPv4 and IPv6 coexist on the internet today, with mechanisms like dual-stack (supporting both IPv4 and IPv6) and tunneling used during the transition period.*/
